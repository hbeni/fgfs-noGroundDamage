FlightGear NoGroundDamage addon
=============================

A common problem with WS2 scenery is on older airports that the taxilines are solid. this causes advanced planes like the c172p and c182s to crash its gear, which is very annoying.

This addon detects when you are on ground for some short time and disables damage. As soon as you are building up speed above 45 knots, damage will be reenabled.

Effectively the goal is to disable damage after you landed, so you can taxi unharmed, and to reenable damage during your flight, automatically.
